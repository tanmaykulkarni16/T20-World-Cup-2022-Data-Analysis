Welcome to my data analytics project based on the T20 Cricket World Cup 2022, held in Australia with participation from 16 nations and around 240 players. This project leverages Power BI for dashboarding, alongside Python (Pandas) and web scraping for data collection and preprocessing.

📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze player performance across multiple roles during the 2022 T20 World Cup and build an interactive dashboard to help cricket enthusiasts and analysts identify top performers, compare stats, and select the best playing XI based on different positions and match situations.

📊 Key Features & Insights

📈 Personal Stats Dashboard for each player with details on runs, averages, strike rates, wickets, and more.

🔍 Identify the best Openers, Power Hitters, Anchors, Finishers, All-Rounders, and Specialist Fast Bowlers of the tournament.

👫 Compare two players’ performance side-by-side, including partnership stats.
